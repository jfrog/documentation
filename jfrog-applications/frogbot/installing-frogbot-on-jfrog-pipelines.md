* Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
* Save the JFrog connection details as a [JFrog Platform Access Token Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Platform+Access+Token+Integration) named **jfrogPlatform**.
* Save your Git access token in a [Git Server Integration](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-integrations) named **gitIntegration**.
* Create a **pipelines.yml** file using one of the available templates and push the file into one of your Git repositories, under a directory named `.jfrog-pipelines`.
* In the **pipelines.yml**, make sure to set values for all the mandatory variables.
*   In the **pipelines.yml**, if you're using a Windows agent, modify the code inside the onExecute sections as described in the template comments.

    **Important**

    * Make sure all the build tools that are used to build the project are installed on the build agent.
