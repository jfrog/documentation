# Setup Frogbot Using Azure Pipelines

**Important Notice**: For Scanning Pull Requests, it is advisable to refrain from setting up Frogbot using Azure Pipelines for open source projects. For further details, please refer to the [üëÆ Security Note for Pull Requests Scanning](../jfrog-applications/frogbot/scan-pull-requests/#security-note-for-pull-requests-scanning).

To install Frogbot on Azure Repos repositories, follow these steps.

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Decide which repository branches you'd like to scan.
3. Go to your Azure Pipelines project, and add a new pipeline.
4. Set `Azure Repos Git` as your code source.
5. Select the repository in which the Frogbot pipelines will reside in.
6. Select `Starter Pipeline` and name it `frogbot`.
7. Use the content of the below templates for the pipeline. Edit the remaining mandatory `Variables`.

_**NOTE:**_ To set up a pull request trigger in Azure Repos, you need to add a branch policy via 'Branch Policies'.

* Go to the "Branches" section:
* For each of the branches against which you want Frogbot to scan pull requests, click on the three dots and select "Branch policies":
* Add new build policy:
* Fill the following build policy parameters and Save:

8.  For the pipeline you created, save the JFrog connection details as variables with the following names - JF\_URL, JF\_USER, and JF\_PASSWORD.

    > _**NOTE:**_ You can also use **JF\_XRAY\_URL** and **JF\_ARTIFACTORY\_URL** instead of **JF\_URL**, and **JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN** instead of **JF\_USER** and **JF\_PASSWORD**.

    To set the `Variables` in the pipeline edit page, click on the `Variables` button and set the `Variables`.
