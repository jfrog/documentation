# Installing Frogbot on GitLab Repositories

## Installing Frogbot on GitLab repositories

To install Frogbot on GitLab repositories using GitLab CI:

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Go to your GitLab repository settings page and save the JFrog connection details as repository secrets with the following names - **JF\_URL**, **JF\_USER**, and **JF\_PASSWORD**

> _**NOTE:**_ You can also use **JF\_XRAY\_URL** and **JF\_ARTIFACTORY\_URL** instead of **JF\_URL**, and **JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN** instead of **JF\_USER** and **JF\_PASSWORD**

3. Add a job named **frogbot-scan** to your **.gitlab-ci.yml** file in your GitLab repository using the code block below.

**Important**

* Set the **JF\_INSTALL\_DEPS\_CMD** variable below, or the **installCommand** property in your frogbot-config.yml file, if the project uses yarn 2, NuGet or .NET to download its dependencies
* Make sure that either **JF\_USER** and **JF\_PASSWORD** or **JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN** are set, **but not both**.
