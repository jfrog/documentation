# Setup Frogbot Using GitHub Actions

### Github Prerequisites

* Go to your repository's **settings** tab and save the JFrog connection details as repository secrets with the following names:
  * **JF\_URL** (JFrog Platform URL - Example: `https://acme.jfrog.io`)
  * **JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN** (JFrog access token)

> You can also use **JF\_XRAY\_URL** and **JF\_ARTIFACTORY\_URL** instead of **JF\_URL**, and **JF\_USER** + **JF\_PASSWORD** instead of **JF\_ACCESS\_TOKEN**

![](../.gitbook/assets/github-repository-secrets.png)

* Under **Actions** > **General**, check the **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** check box.

![](../.gitbook/assets/github-pr-permissions.png)

* For open-source projects: Create a new [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) called **frogbot** and add people or public teams as reviewers. The chosen reviewers can trigger Frogbot scans on pull requests.

### Frogbot GitHub Action Templates

1. Begin by cloning the GitHub repository to your local environment.

2. Switch to the target branch where you'd like the pull requests to be scanned.

3. Create a file named **frogbot-scan-pull-request.yml**. Fill it with the template provided below, and then push it into the **.github/workflows** directory at the root of your GitHub repository.

    ```yaml
    name: "Frogbot Scan Pull Request"
    on:
      pull_request_target:
        types: [opened, synchronize]
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    jobs:
      scan-pull-request:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        # A pull request needs to be approved before Frogbot scans it. Any GitHub user who is associated with the
        # "frogbot" GitHub environment can approve the pull request to be scanned.
        environment: frogbot
