#### Downloading External Resources Through Artifactory

The JFrog IDEA Plugin requires necessary resources for scanning your projects.
By default, the JFrog IDEA Plugin downloads the resources it requires from <https://releases.jfrog.io>. If the machine running IDEA has no access to it, follow these steps to allow the resources to be downloaded through an Artifactory instance, which the machine has access to:

1. Login to the JFrog Platform UI, with a user who has admin permissions.

2. Create a Remote Repository with the following properties set:
    - Under the `Basic` tab:
        - Package Type: Generic
        - Repository Key: jfrog-releases-repository
        - URL: <https://releases.jfrog.io>

        - Uncheck the `Store Artifacts Locally` option
