#### Preconditions

* npm 7 and above
* JFrog CLI's `jf` executable - required for tests

To build the extension from sources, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the code from Github.
2. Update submodules:

```
git submodule init

```

3. Build and create the VS-Code extension vsix file by running the following npm command:

```bash
