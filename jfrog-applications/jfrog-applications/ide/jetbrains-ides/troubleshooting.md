# Troubleshooting

The JFrog Plugin uses the IDE log files. By default, the log level used by the plugin is INFO.

You have the option of increasing the log level to DEBUG. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to **Help** | **Diagnostic Tools** | **Debug Log Settings...**
2. Inside the **Custom Debug Log Configuration** window add the following line:

```java
#com.jfrog.ide.idea.log.Logger
```

To see the IDE log file, depending on the IDE version and OS as described [here](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files), go to **Help** | **Show/reveal Log in Explorer/finder/Konqueror/Nautilus**.
