# Scan Git Repositories

Frogbot scans your Git repositories periodically and automatically creates pull requests for upgrading vulnerable dependencies to a version with a fix.

_**NOTE:**_ The pull request fix is presently unavailable for older NuGet projects that use the package.config file instead of the PackageReference syntax.
