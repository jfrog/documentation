# View Security Alerts on Github

For GitHub repositories, issues that are found during Frogbot's periodic scans are also added to the [Security Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository) view in the UI.

**5. Validate Allowed Licenses**

When Frogbot scans the repository periodically, it checks the licenses of any project dependencies. If Frogbot identifies licenses that are not listed in a predefined set of approved licenses, it adds an alert. The list of allowed licenses is set up as a variable within the Frogbot workflow.
