**Managing JFrog Workers**

Workers is a JFrog Platform service that allows you to extend and control your execution flows. It provides a serverless execution environment. You can create workers to enhance the platform's functionality. Workers are triggered automatically by events within the JFrog Platform, giving you the flexibility to address specific use cases. For on-demand tasks, configure Http-triggered workers.
