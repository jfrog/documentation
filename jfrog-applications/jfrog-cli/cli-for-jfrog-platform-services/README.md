**Managing JFrog Workers**

Workers is a JFrog Platform service that you can use to extend and control your execution flows. It provides a serverless execution environment. You can create workers to enhance the platform's functionality. Workers are triggered automatically by events within the JFrog Platform, which addresses specific use cases. For on-demand tasks, configure HTTP-triggered workers.
