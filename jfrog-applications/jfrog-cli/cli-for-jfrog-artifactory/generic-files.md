| Target path        | <p>The second argument specifies the target path in Artifactory in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the target path ends with a slash, the path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be uploaded. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the uploaded file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the uploaded file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the upload path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory/using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

### Examples
#### Example 1

Upload a file called **froggy.tgz** to the root of the **my-local-repo** repository.

```
jf rt u froggy.tgz my-local-repo
```

#### Example 2

Collect all the zip files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, while maintaining the original names of the files.

```
jf rt u "build/*.zip" my-local-repo/zipFiles/
```

#### Example 3

Collect all the zip files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, while maintaining the original names of the files. Also delete all files in the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, except for the files which were uploaded by this command.

```
jf rt u "build/*.zip" my-local-repo/zipFiles/ --sync-deletes="my-local-repo/zipFiles/"
```

#### Example 4

Collect all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the \*\*my-release-local \*\*repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts. Exclude (do not upload) files, which include **install** as part of their path, and have the **pack** extension. This example uses a wildcard pattern. See **Example 5**, which uses regular expressions instead.

```
jf rt u "build/" my-release-local/files/ --exclusions="\*install\*pack*"
```

#### Example 5

Collect all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-release-local** repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts. Exclude (do not upload) files, which include **install** as part of their path, and have the **pack** extension. This example uses a regular expression. See **Example 4**, which uses a wildcard pattern instead.

```
jf rt u "build/" my-release-local/files/ --regexp --exclusions="(.*)install.*pack$"
```

#### Example 6

Collect all files located under the **build** directory and match the **/\*.zip** ANT pattern, and upload them to the **my-release-local** repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts.

```
jf rt u "build/**/*.zip" my-release-local/files/ --ant
```

#### Example 7

Package all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories) into a zip archive named **archive.zip** , and upload the archive to the **my-local-repo** repository,

```
jf rt u "build/" my-local-repo/my-archive.zip --archive zip
```

## Downloading Files

This command is used to download files from Artifactory.

> Download from Remote Repositories:\
> \
> By default, the command only downloads files that are cached on the current Artifactory instance. It does not download files located on remote Artifactory instances, through remote or virtual repositories. To allow the command to download files from remote Artifactory instances, which are proxied by the use of remote repositories, set the **JFROG\_CLI\_TRANSITIVE\_DOWNLOAD\_EXPERIMENTAL** environment variable to **true**. This functionality requires version 7.17 or above of Artifactory. The remote download functionality is supported only on remote repositories which proxy repositories on remote Artifactory instances. Downloading through a remote repository that proxies non-Artifactory repositories is not supported.

| Target path         | <p>The second argument is optional and specifies the local file system target path.<br><br>If the target path ends with a slash, the path is assumed to be a directory. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a directory into which files should be downloaded. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the downloaded file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "a/b", the downloaded file is renamed to "b".<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the target path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory/using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

| Target path       | <p>Specifies the target path in Artifactory, to which the artifacts should be copied, in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the pattern ends with a slash, the target path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be copied. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the copied file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the copied file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the target path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory/using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

### Examples

| Target path       | <p>Specifies the target path in Artifactory, to which the artifacts should be moved, in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the pattern ends with a slash, the target path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be moved. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the moved file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the moved file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the upload path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory/using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

### Examples
#### Example 1

Move all artifacts located under **/rabbit** in the **source-frog-repo** repository into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository.

```
jf rt mv source-frog-repo/rabbit/ target-frog-repo/rabbit/
```

#### Example 2

Move all zip files located under **/rabbit** in the **source-frog-repo** repository into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository.

```
jf rt mv "source-frog-repo/rabbit/*.zip" target-frog-repo/rabbit/
