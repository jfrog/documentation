# CLI for JFrog Artifactory

## Overview

This page describes how to use JFrog CLI with JFrog Artifactory.

Read more about JFrog CLI [here](../README.md).

## Environment Variables

The Artifactory upload command makes use of the following environment variable:

|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Authentication

When used with Artifactory, JFrog CLI offers several means of authentication: JFrog CLI does not support accessing Artifactory without authentication.

### Authenticating with Username and Password / API Key

To authenticate yourself using your JFrog login credentials, either configure your credentials once using the **jf c add** command or provide the following option to each command.

| Command option | Description                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --url          | JFrog Artifactory API endpoint URL. It usually ends with /artifactory |
| --user         | JFrog username                                                        |
| --password     | JFrog password or API key                                             |

For enhanced security, when JFrog CLI is configured to use a username and password / API key, it automatically generates an access token to authenticate with Artifactory. The generated access token is valid for one hour only. JFrog CLI automatically refreshed the token before it expires. The **jfrog c add** command allows disabling this functionality. This feature is currently not supported by commands which use external tools or package managers or work with JFrog Distribution.

### Authenticating with an Access Token

To authenticate yourself using an Artifactory Access Token, either configure your Access Token once using the **jf c add** command or provide the following option to each command.

| Command option | Description                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --url          | JFrog Artifactory API endpoint URL. It usually ends with /artifactory |
| --access-token | JFrog access token                                                    |

### Authenticating with RSA Keys

***

**Note**

> Currently, authentication with RSA keys is not supported when working with external package managers and build tools (Maven, Gradle, Npm, Docker, Go and NuGet) or with the cUrl integration.

***

From version 4.4, Artifactory supports SSH authentication using RSA public and private keys. To authenticate yourself to Artifactory using RSA keys, execute the following instructions:

* Enable SSH authentication as described in [Configuring SSH](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-platform-administration-Documentation/Managing-Ssh-Keys).
*   Configure your Artifactory URL to have the following format: `ssh://[host]:[port]` There are two ways to do this:

    * For each command, use the `--url` command option.
    * Specify the Artifactory URL in the correct format using the **jfrog c add** command.

    ***

    **Warning**\
    \
    **Don't include your Artifactory context URL**

    > Make sure that the \[host] component of the URL only includes the hostname or the IP, but not your Artifactory context URL.

    ***
* Configure the path to your SSH key file. There are two ways to do this:
  * For each command, use the `--ssh-key-path` command option.
  * Specify the path using the **jfrog c add** command.

### Authenticating using Client Certificates (mTLS)

From Artifactory release 7.38.4, you can authenticate users using a client certificate ([mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual\_authentication#mTLS)). To do so will require a reverse proxy and some setup on the front reverse proxy (Nginx). Read about how to set this up [here](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/Http-Settings).

To authenticate with the proxy using a client certificate, either configure your certificate once using the **jf c add** command or use the --`client-cert-path` and`--client-cert-ket-path` command options with each command.

***

**Note**

> Authentication using client certificates (mTLS) is not supported by commands which integrate with package managers.

***

Not Using a Public CA (Certificate Authority)?

This section is relevant for you if you're not using a public CA (Certificate Authority) to issue the SSL certificate used to connect to your Artifactory domain. You may not be using a public CA either because you're using self-signed certificates or you're running your own PKI services in-house (often by using a Microsoft CA).

In this case, you'll need to make those certificates available for JFrog CLI, by placing them inside the **security/certs** directory, which is under JFrog CLI's home directory. By default, the home directory is **\~/.jfrog**, but it can be also set using the **JFROG\_CLI\_HOME\_DIR** environment variable.

**Note**

1. The supported certificate format is PEM.
2. Some commands support the **--insecure-tls** option, which skips the TLS certificates verification.
3. Before version 1.37.0, JFrog CLI expected the certificates to be located directly under the **security** directory. JFrog CLI will automatically move the certificates to the new directory when installing version 1.37.0 or above. Downgrading back to an older version requires replacing the configuration directory manually. You'll find a backup if the old configuration under **.jfrog/backup**

## Storing Symlinks in Artifactory

JFrog CLI lets you upload and download artifacts from your local file system to Artifactory, this also includes uploading symlinks (soft links).

Symlinks are stored in Artifactory as files with a zero size, with the following properties:\
**symlink.dest** - The actual path on the original filesystem to which the symlink points\
**symlink.destsha1** - the SHA1 checksum of the value in the **symlink.dest** property

To upload symlinks, the `jf rt upload` command should be executed with the `--symlinks` option set to true.

When downloading symlinks stored in Artifactory, the CLI can verify that the file to which the symlink points actually exists and that it has the correct SHA1 checksum. To add this validation, you should use the `--validate-symlinks` option with the `jf rt download` command.

***

## Using Placeholders

The JFrog CLI offers enormous flexibility in how you **download, upload**, **copy**, or **move** files through the use of wildcard or regular expressions with placeholders.

Any wildcard enclosed in parentheses in the source path can be matched with a corresponding placeholder in the target path to determine the name of the artifact once uploaded.

#### Example 1: Upload all files to the target repository

For each .tgz file in the source directory, create a corresponding directory with the same name in the target repository and upload it there. For example, a file named **froggy.tgz** should be uploaded to **my-local-rep/froggy**. **froggy** will be created in a folder in Artifactory).

```
jf rt u "(*).tgz" my-local-repo/{1}/ --recursive=false
```

#### Example 2: Upload all files sharing the same prefix to the target repository

Upload all files whose name begins with "frog" to folder **frogfiles** in the target repository, but append its name with the text "-up". For example, a file called **froggy.tgz** should be renamed **froggy.tgz-up**.

```
jf u "(frog*)" my-local-repo/frogfiles/{1}-up --recursive=false
```

#### Example 3: Upload all files to corresponding directories according to extension type

Upload all files in the current directory to the **my-local-repo** repository and place them in directories that match their file extensions.

```
jf rt u "(*).(*)" my-local-repo/{2}/{1}.{2} --recursive=false
```

#### Example 4: Copy all zip files to target repository and append with an extension

Copy all zip files under /rabbit in the **source-frog-repo** repository into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository and append the copied files' names with ".cp".

```
jf rt cp "source-frog-repo/rabbit/(*.zip)" target-frog-repo/rabbit/{1}.cp
```

## General Commands

The following sections describe the commands available in the JFrog CLI for use with Artifactory.

### Verifying Artifactory is Accessible

This command can be used to verify that Artifactory is accessible by sending an applicative ping to Artifactory.

| Source path        | The first argument specifies the local file system path to artifacts that should be uploaded to Artifactory.

Please read the **--regexp** option description for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Target path        | <p>The second argument specifies the target path in Artifactory in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the target path ends with a slash, the path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be uploaded. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the uploaded file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the uploaded file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the upload path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

#### Example 1

Upload a file called **froggy.tgz** to the root of the **my-local-repo** repository.

```
jf rt u froggy.tgz my-local-repo
```

#### Example 2

Collect all the zip files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, while maintaining the original names of the files.

```
jf rt u "build/*.zip" my-local-repo/zipFiles/
```

#### Example 3

Collect all the zip files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, while maintaining the original names of the files. Also delete all files in the **my-local-repo** repository, under the **zipFiles** folder, except for the files which were uploaded by this command.

```
jf rt u "build/*.zip" my-local-repo/zipFiles/ --sync-deletes="my-local-repo/zipFiles/"
```

#### Example 4

Collect all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the \*\*my-release-local \*\*repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts. Exclude (do not upload) files, which include **install** as part of their path, and have the **pack** extension. This example uses a wildcard pattern. See **Example 5**, which uses regular expressions instead.

```
jf rt u "build/" my-release-local/files/ --exclusions="\*install\*pack*"
```

#### Example 5

Collect all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories), and upload them to the **my-release-local** repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts. Exclude (do not upload) files, which include **install** as part of their path, and have the **pack** extension. This example uses a regular expression.

```
jf rt u "build/" my-release-local/files/ --regexp --exclusions="(.*)install.*pack$"
```

#### Example 6

Collect all files located under the **build** directory and match the **/\*.zip** ANT pattern, and upload them to the **my-release-local** repository, under the **files** folder, while maintaining the original names of the artifacts.

```
jf rt u "build/**/*.zip" my-release-local/files/ --ant
```

#### Example 7

Package all files located under the **build** directory (including subdirectories) into a zip archive named **archive.zip** , and upload the archive to the **my-local-repo** repository,

```
jf rt u "build/" my-local-repo/my-archive.zip --archive zip
```

### Downloading Files

This command is used to download files from Artifactory.

> Download from Remote Repositories:\
> \
> By default, the command only downloads files that are cached on the current Artifactory instance. It does not download files located on remote Artifactory instances, through remote or virtual repositories. To allow the command to download files from remote Artifactory instances, which are proxied by the use of remote repositories, set the **JFROG\_CLI\_TRANSITIVE\_DOWNLOAD\_EXPERIMENTAL** environment variable to **true**. This functionality requires version 7.17 or above of Artifactory. The remote download functionality is supported only on remote repositories which proxy repositories on remote Artifactory instances. Downloading through a remote repository that proxies non-Artifactory repositories is not supported.

| Target path         | <p>The second argument is optional and specifies the local file system target path.<br><br>If the target path ends with a slash, the path is assumed to be a directory. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a directory into which files should be downloaded. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the downloaded file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "a/b", the downloaded file is renamed to "b".<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the target path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

| Target path       | <p>Specifies the target path in Artifactory, to which the artifacts should be copied, in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the pattern ends with a slash, the target path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be copied. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the copied file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the copied file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the target path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#using-placeholders">Using Placeholders</a>.</p> |

#### Example 1

Copy all artifacts located under **/rabbit** in the **source-frog-repo** repository into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository.

```
jf rt cp source-frog-repo/rabbit/ target-frog-repo/rabbit/
```

#### Example 2

Copy all zip files located under **/rabbit** in the **source-frog-repo** repository into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository.

```
jf rt cp "source-frog-repo/rabbit/*.zip" target-frog-repo/rabbit/
```

#### Example 3

Copy all artifacts located under **/rabbit** in the **source-frog-repo** repository and with property "Version=1.0" into the same path in the **target-frog-repo** repository.

```
jf rt cp "source-frog-repo/rabbit/*" target-frog-repo/rabbit/ --props=Version=1.0
```

| Target path       | <p>Specifies the target path in Artifactory, to which the artifacts should be moved, in the following format: <code>[repository name]/[repository path]</code><br><br>If the pattern ends with a slash, the target path is assumed to be a folder. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory into which files should be moved. If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the moved file should be renamed. For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b", the moved file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.<br><br>For flexibility in specifying the upload path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis.

## Downloading the Maven and Gradle Extractor JARs

For integrating with Maven and Gradle, JFrog CLI uses the build-info-extractor jars files. These jar files are downloaded by JFrog CLI from jcenter the first time they are needed.

If you're using JFrog CLI on a machine which has no access to the internet, you can configure JFrog CLI to download these jar files from an Artifactory instance. Here's how to configure Artifactory and JFrog CLI to download the jars files.

1. Create a remote Maven repository in Artifactory and name it **extractors**. When creating the repository, configure it to proxy [https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/oss-release-local](https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/oss-release-local)
2. Make sure that this Artifactory server is known to JFrog CLI, using the [jfrog c show](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/configurations/jfrog-platform-configuration#showing-the-configured-servers) command. If not, configure it using the [jfrog c add](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/Adding-and-Editing-Configured-Servers) command.
3. Set the **JFROG\_CLI\_EXTRACTORS\_REMOTE** environment variable with the server ID of the Artifactory server you configured, followed by a slash, and then the name of the repository you created. For example _**my-rt-server/extractors**_
