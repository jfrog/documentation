# Package Managers Integration

## Running Maven Builds

JFrog CLI includes integration with Maven, allowing you to resolve dependencies and deploy build artifacts from and to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.

### Setting maven repositories

Before using the **mvn** command, the project needs to be pre-configured with the Artifactory server and repositories, to be used for building and publishing the project. The **mvn-config** command should be used once to add the configuration to the project. The command should run while inside the root directory of the project. The configuration is stored by the command in the **.jfrog** directory at the root directory of the project.

### Running maven

The **mvn** command triggers the maven client, while resolving dependencies and deploying artifacts from and to Artifactory.

> **Note**: Before running the **mvn** command on a project for the first time, the project should be configured with the **mvn-config** command.

> **Note**: If the machine running JFrog CLI has no access to the internet, make sure to read the [Downloading the Maven and Gradle Extractor JARs](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#downloading-the-maven-and-gradle-extractor-jars) section.

| Command arguments | The command accepts the same arguments and options as the mvn client.                                                                                          |

#### Deploying Maven Artifacts

The deployment to Artifacts is triggered both by the deployment and install phases. To disable artifacts deployment, add\*\* **-Dartifactory.publish.artifacts=false** to the list of goals and options. For example: "**clean install**\*\*-Dartifactory.publish.artifacts=false"\*\*


#### Example

Run clean and install with maven.

```
jf mvn clean install -f path/to/pom-file
```

## Running Gradle Builds

JFrog CLI includes integration with Gradle, allowing you to resolve dependencies and deploy build artifacts from and to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.

### Setting gradle repositories

Before using the **gradle** command, the project needs to be pre-configured with the Artifactory server and repositories, to be used for building and publishing the project. The **gradle-config** command should be used once to add the configuration to the project. The command should run while inside the root directory of the project. The configuration is stored by the command in the\*\*.jfrog\*\* directory at the root directory of the project.

#### Example

Build the project using the **artifactoryPublish** task, while resolving and deploying artifacts from and to Artifactory.

```
jf gradle clean artifactoryPublish -b path/to/build.gradle
```

## Downloading the Maven and Gradle Extractor JARs

For integrating with Maven and Gradle, JFrog CLI uses the build-info-extractor jars files. These jar files are downloaded by JFrog CLI from jcenter the first time they are needed.

If you're using JFrog CLI on a machine which has no access to the internet, you can configure JFrog CLI to download these jar files from an Artifactory instance. Here's how to configure Artifactory and JFrog CLI to download the jars files.

1. Create a remote Maven repository in Artifactory and name it **extractors**. When creating the repository, configure it to proxy [https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/oss-release-local](https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/oss-release-local)
2. Make sure that this Artifactory server is known to JFrog CLI, using the [jfrog c show](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/configurations/jfrog-platform-configuration#showing-the-configured-servers) command. If not, configure it using the [jfrog c add](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/Adding-and-Editing-Configured-Servers) command.
3. Set the **JFROG\_CLI\_EXTRACTORS\_REMOTE** environment variable with the server ID of the Artifactory server you configured, followed by a slash, and then the name of the repository you created. For example _**my-rt-server/extractors**_

## Running Builds with MSBuild

JFrog CLI includes integration with MSBuild and Artifactory, allowing you to resolve dependencies and deploy build artifacts from and to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory. This is done by having JFrog CLI in your search path and adding JFrog CLI commands to the MSBuild `csproj` file.

For detailed instructions, please refer to our [MSBuild Project Example](https://github.com/eyalbe4/project-examples/tree/master/msbuild-example) on GitHub.

## Managing Docker Images

JFrog CLI provides full support for pulling and publishing docker images from and to Artifactory using the docker client running on the same machine. This allows you to collect build-info for your docker build and then publish it to Artifactory. You can also promote the pushed docker images from one repository to another in Artifactory.

To build and push your docker images to Artifactory, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Artifactory can be used as docker registry. Please refer to [Getting Started with Docker and Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/Getting-Started-With-Artifactory-As-A-docker-Registry) in the JFrog Artifactory User Guide.
2. Make sure that the installed docker client has version **17.07.0-ce (2017-08-29)** or above. To verify this, run **docker -v**\*\*
3. To ensure that the docker client and your Artifactory docker registry are correctly configured to work together, run the following code snippet.

```
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world:latest &lt;artifactoryDockerRegistry&gt;/hello-world:latest
docker login &lt;artifactoryDockerRegistry&gt;
docker push &lt;artifactoryDockerRegistry&gt;/hello-world:latest
```

If everything is configured correctly, pushing any image including the hello-world image should be successfully uploaded to Artifactory.

> **Note**: When running the docker-pull and docker-push commands, the CLI will first attempt to log in to the docker registry. In case of a login failure, the command will not be executed.

### Examples

Check out our [docker project examples on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/docker-oci-examples).

### Pulling Docker Images Using the Docker Client

Running **docker-pull** command allows pulling docker images from Artifactory, while collecting the build-info and storing it locally, so that it can be later published to Artifactory, using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

| Command arguments | The same arguments and options supported by the docker client/                                                                                                 |

#### Example

The subsequent command utilizes the docker client to pull the 'my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest' image from Artifactory. This operation logs the image layers as dependencies of the local build-info identified by the build name 'my-build-name' and build number '7'. This local build-info can subsequently be released to Artifactory using the command 'jf rt bp my-build-name 7'."

```
jf docker pull my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=7
```

You can then publish the build-info collected by the **docker-pull** command to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

### Pushing Docker Images Using the Docker Client

After building your image using the docker client, the **docker-push** command pushes the image layers to Artifactory, while collecting the build-info and storing it locally, so that it can be later published to Artifactory, using the **build-publish** command.

#### Example

The subsequent command utilizes the docker client to push the 'my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest' image to Artifactory. This operation logs the image layers as artifacts of the local build-info identified by the build name 'my-build-name' and build number '7'. This local build-info can subsequently be released to Artifactory using the command 'jf rt bp my-build-name 7'."

```
jf docker push my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=7
```

You can then publish the build-info collected by the **docker-push** command to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

### Pulling Docker Images Using Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers. Running the **podman-pull** command allows pulling docker images from Artifactory using podman, while collecting the build-info and storing it locally, so that it can be later published to Artifactory, using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

#### Example

In this example, podman is employed to pull the local image 'my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest' from the docker-local Artifactory repository. During this process, it registers the image layers as depedencies within a build-info identified by the build name 'my-build-name' and build number '7'. This build-info is initially established locally and must be subsequently published to Artifactory using the command 'jf rt build-publish my-build-name 7'.

```
jf rt podman-pull my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest docker-local --build-name my-build-name --build-number 7
```

You can then publish the build-info collected by the **podman-pull** command to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

### Pushing Docker Images Using Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemon-less container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers. After building your image, the **podman-push** command pushes the image layers to Artifactory, while collecting the build-info and storing it locally, so that it can be later published to Artifactory, using the **build-publish** command.

#### Example

In this illustration, podman is employed to push the local image 'my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest' to the docker-local Artifactory repository. During this process, it registers the image layers as artifacts within a build-info identified by the build name 'my-build-name' and build number '7'. This build-info is initially established locally and must be subsequently published to Artifactory using the command 'jf rt build-publish my-build-name 7'.

```
jf rt podman-push my-docker-registry.io/my-docker-image:latest docker-local --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=7
```

You can then publish the build-info collected by the **podman-push** command to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

### Pushing Docker Images Using Kaniko

JFrog CLI allows pushing containers to Artifactory using [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#kaniko---build-images-in-kubernetes), while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.\
For detailed instructions, please refer to our [Kaniko project example on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/docker-oci-examples/kaniko-example).

### Pushing Docker Images Using buildx

For detailed instructions, please refer to our [buildx project example on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/docker-oci-examples/fat-manifest-example).

### Pushing Docker Images Using the OpenShift CLI

JFrog CLI allows pushing containers to Artifactory using the [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli\_reference/openshift\_cli/getting-started-cli.html), while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.\
For detailed instructions, please refer to our [OpenShift build project example on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/docker-oci-examples/openshift-examples/openshift-build-example).

### Adding Published Docker Images to the Build-Info

The **build-docker-create** command allows adding a docker image, which is already published to Artifactory, into the build-info. This build-info can be later published to Artifactory, using the **build-publish** command.

#### Example

In this example, a Docker image that has already been deployed to Artifactory is incorporated into a locally created, unpublished build-info identified by the build name 'myBuild' and build number '1'. This local build-info can subsequently be published to Artifactory using the command 'jf rt bp myBuild 1'.

```
jf rt bdc docker-local --image-file image-file-details --build-name myBuild --build-number 1
```

You can then publish the build-info collected by the **podman-push** command to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.

### Promoting Docker Images

Promotion is the action of moving or copying a group of artifacts from one repository to another, to support the artifacts' lifecycle. When it comes to docker images, there are two ways to promote a docker image which was pushed to Artifactory:

1. Create build-info for the docker image, and then promote the build using the **jf rt build-promote** command.
2. Use the **jf rt docker-promote** command as described below.

#### Examples

Promote the **hello-world** docker image from the **docker-dev-local** repository to the **docker-staging-local** repository.

```
jf rt docker-promote hello-world docker-dev-local docker-staging-local
```

## Building Npm Packages Using the Npm Client

JFrog CLI provides full support for building npm packages using the npm client. This allows you to resolve npm dependencies, and publish your npm packages from and to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.

Follow these guidelines when building npm packages:

* You can download npm packages from any npm repository type - local, remote or virtual, but you can only publish to a local or virtual Artifactory repository, containing local repositories. To publish to a virtual repository, you first need to set a default local repository. For more details, please refer to [Deploying to a Virtual Repository](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/virtual-repositories).
* When the **npm-publish** command runs, JFrog CLI runs the **pack** command in the background. The pack action is followed by an upload, which is not based on the npm client's publish command. Therefore, If your npm package includes the **prepublish** or **postpublish** scripts, rename them to **prepack** and **postpack** respectively.

**Requirements**

Npm client version 5.4.0 and above.

Artifactory version 5.5.2 and above.

### Setting npm repositories

Before using the **npm-install**, **npm-ci** and **npm-publish** commands, the project needs to be pre-configured with the Artifactory server and repositories, to be used for building and publishing the project. The **npm-config** command should be used once to add the configuration to the project. The command should run while inside the root directory of the project. The configuration is stored by the command in the **.jfrog** directory at the root directory of the project.

#### Examples
##### Example 1

The following example installs the dependencies and records them locally as part of build **my-build-name/1**. The build-info can later be published to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command. The dependencies are resolved from the Artifactory server and repository configured by **npm-config** command.

```
jf npm install --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=1
```

##### Example 2

The following example installs the dependencies. The dependencies are resolved from the Artifactory server and repository configured by **npm-config** command.

```
jf npm install
```

##### Example 3

The following example installs the dependencies using the npm-ci command. The dependencies are resolved from the Artifactory server and repository configured by **npm-config** command.

```
jf npm ci
```

### Publishing the Npm Packages into Artifactory

The **npm-publish** command packs and deploys the npm package to the designated npm repository.

Before running the **npm-publish** command on a project for the first time, the project should be configured using the **npm-config** command. This configuration includes the Artifactory server and repository to which the package should deploy.

> **Warning**: If your npm package includes the prepublish or postpublish scripts, please refer to the guidelines above.

#### Example

To pack and publish the npm package and also record it locally as part of build **my-build-name/1**, run the following command. The build-info can later be published to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command. The package is published to the Artifactory server and repository configured by **npm-config** command.

```
jf npm publish --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=1
```

## Building Npm Packages Using the Yarn Client

JFrog CLI provides full support for building npm packages using the yarn client. This allows you to resolve npm dependencies, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory. You can download npm packages from any npm repository type - local, remote or virtual. Publishing the packages to a local npm repository is supported through the **jf rt upload** command.

Yarn version 2.4.0 and above is supported.

### Setting npm repositories

Before using the **jf yarn** command, the project needs to be pre-configured with the Artifactory server and repositories, to be used for building the project. The **yarn-config** command should be used once to add the configuration to the project. The command should run while inside the root directory of the project. The configuration is stored by the command in the **.jfrog** directory at the root directory of the project.

```
jf yarn install
```

## Building Go Packages

### General

JFrog CLI provides full support for building Go packages using the Go client. This allows resolving Go dependencies from and publish your Go packages to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.

### Requirements

JFrog CLI client version 1.20.0 and above.

Artifactory version 6.1.0 and above.

Go client version 1.11.0 and above.

### Example project

To help you get started, you can use [this sample project on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/golang-example).

### Setting Go repositories

Before you can use JFrog CLI to build your Go projects with Artifactory, you first need to set the resolutions and deployment repositories for the project.

Here's how you set the repositories.

1. 'cd' into to the root of the Go project.
2. Run the **jf rt go-config** command.

## Building Python Packages

JFrog CLI provides full support for building Python packages using the **pip** and **pipenv** and **poetry** package installers. This allows resolving python dependencies from Artifactory, while (for **pip** and **pipenv**) recording the downloaded packages. The downloaded packages are stored as dependencies in the build-info stored in Artifactory.

Once the packages are installed, the Python project can be then built and packaged using the pip, pipenv or poetry clients. Once built, the produced artifacts can be uploaded to Artifactory using JFrog CLI's upload command and registered as artifacts in the build-info.

### Example projects

To help you get started, you can use [the sample projects on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/python-example).

### Setting Python repository

Before you can use JFrog CLI to build your Python projects with Artifactory, you first need to set the repository for the project.

Here's how you set the repositories.

1. 'cd' into the root of the Python project.
2. Run the **jf pip-config**, **jf pipenv-config** or **jf poetry-config** commands, depending on whether you're using the pip, pipenv or poetry clients.

### Installing Python packages

The **pip install**, **pipenv install** and **poetry install** commands use the **pip**, **pipenv** and **poetry** clients respectively, to install the project dependencies from Artifactory. The **pip install** and **pipenv install** commands can also record these packages as build dependencies as part of the build-info published to Artifactory.

> **Note**: Before running the **pip install**, **pipenv install** and **poetry install** commands on a project for the first time, the project should be configured using the **pip-config** ,**pipenv-config** or **poetry-config** commands respectively.

**Recording all dependencies** - currently available for pip and pipenv.

JFrog CLI records the installed packages as build-info dependencies. The recorded dependencies are packages installed during the **jf pip install** and **jf pipenv install** command execution. When running the command inside a Python environment, which already has some of the packages installed, the installed packages will not be included as part of the build-info, because they were not originally installed by JFrog CLI. A warning message will be added to the log in this case.

**How to include all packages in the build-info?**

The details of all the installed packages are always cached by the **jf pip install** and **jf pipenv install** command in the **.jfrog/projects/deps.cache.json** file, located under the root of the project. JFrog CLI uses this cache for including previously installed packages in the build-info.\
If the Python environment had some packages installed prior to the first execution of the 'install' command, those previously installed packages will be missing from the cache and therefore will not be included in the build-info.

Running the 'install' command with both the **no-cache-dir** and **force-reinstall** pip options, should re-download and install these packages, and they will therefore be included in the build-info and added to the cache. It is also recommended to run the command from inside a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## Building NuGet Packages

JFrog CLI provides full support for restoring NuGet packages using the NuGet client or the .NET Core CLI. This allows you to resolve NuGet dependencies from and publish your NuGet packages to Artifactory, while collecting build-info and storing it in Artifactory.

NuGet dependencies resolution is supported by the `jf nuget` command, which uses the NuGet client or the `jf dotnet` command, which uses the .NET Core CLI.

To publish your NuGet packages to Artifactory, use the [jf rt upload](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#uploading-files) command.

### Setting NuGet repositories

Before using the**nuget** or **dotnet** commands, the project needs to be pre-configured with the Artifactory server and repository, to be used for building the project.

Before using the nuget or dotnet commands, the **nuget-config** or **dotnet-config** commands should be used respectively. These commands configure the project with the details of the Artifactory server and repository, to be used for the build. The **nuget-config** or **dotnet-config** commands should be executed while inside the root directory of the project. The configuration is stored by the command in the **.jfrog** directory at the root directory of the project. You then have the option of storing the .jfrog directory with the project sources, or creating this configuration after the sources are checked out.


The following table lists the commands' options:

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Running Nuget and Dotnet commands

The **nuget** command runs the **NuGet client** and the **dotnet** command runs the \*\*.NET Core CLI.

> Before running the nuget command on a project for the first time, the project should be configured using the nuget-config command.

> Before running the dotnet command on a project for the first time, the project should be configured using the dotnet-config command.

#### Examples
##### Example 1

Run nuget restore for the solution at the current directory, while resolving the NuGet dependencies from the pre-configured Artifactory repository. Use the NuGet client for this command

```
jf nuget restore
```

##### Example 2

Run dotnet restore for the solution at the current directory, while resolving the NuGet dependencies from the pre-configured Artifactory repository. Use the .NET Core CLI for this command

```
jf dotnet restore
```

##### Example 3

Run dotnet restore for the solution at the current directory, while resolving the NuGet dependencies from the pre-configured Artifactory repository.

```
jf dotnet restore --build-name=my-build-name --build-number=1
```

In addition, record the build-info as part of build **my-build-name/1**. The build-info can later be published to Artifactory using the [build-publish](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli/cli-for-jfrog-artifactory#publishing-build-info) command.


## Packaging and Publishing Terraform Modules

JFrog CLI supports packaging Terraform modules and publishing them to a Terraform repository in Artifactory using the **jf terraform publish** command.

We recommend using [this example project on GitHub](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/terraform-example) for an easy start up.

Before using the **jf terraform publish** command for the first time, you first need to configure the Terraform repository for your Terraform project. To do this, follow these steps:

1. 'cd' into the root directory for your Terraform project.
2. Run the interactive **jf terraform-config** command and set deployment repository name.

### terraform-config

The **jf terraform-config** command will store the repository name inside the **.jfrog** directory located in the current directory. You can also add the **--global** command option, if you prefer the repository configuration applies to all projects on the machine. In that case, the configuration will be saved in JFrog CLI's home directory.

#### Examples
##### Example 1

The command creates a package for the Terraform module in the current directory, and publishes it to the Terraform repository (configured by the **jf tfc command**) with the provides namespace, provider and tag.

```
jf tf p --namespace example --provider aws --tag v0.0.1
```

##### Example 2

The command creates a package for the Terraform module in the current directory, and publishes it to the Terraform repository (configured by the **jf tfc command**) with the provides namespace, provider and tag. The published package will not include the module paths which include either **test** or **ignore** .

```
jf tf p --namespace example --provider aws --tag v0.0.1 --exclusions "\*test\*;\*ignore\*"
```

##### Example 3

The command creates a package for the Terraform module in the current directory, and publishes it to the Terraform repository (configured by the **jf tfc** command) with the provides namespace, provider and tag. The published module will be recorded as an artifact of a build named **my-build** with build number **1**. The **jf rt bp** command publishes the build to Artifactory.

```
jf tf p --namespace example --provider aws --tag v0.0.1 --build-name my-build --build-number 1
jf rt bp my-build 1
```
