# CLI AI Assistant

**ONLY ACTIVE JFROG CUSTOMERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE THE JFROG AI ASSISTANT. ALL OTHER USES ARE PROHIBITED.**

## Overview

The JFrog CLI AI Command Assistant streamlines your workflow by turning natural language inputs into JFrog CLI commands. Describe your desired actions, and the assistant generates commands with all necessary parameters, whether you are uploading artifacts, managing repositories, scanning your code, or performing other actions using the JFrog CLI.

Each query is treated individually, and while the interface allows you to refine requests, it does not maintain a chat history. This tool helps you access the full power of JFrog CLI without needing to remember specific syntax, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

**Note:** This is the first version of JFrog CLI AI; therefore, it is limited only to Artifactory and Xray commands.
